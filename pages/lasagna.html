    <h2>Step 1 Making the Sauce</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Start by making the sauce </strong>with ground beef, bell peppers,
      onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
      The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2 Heat the sauce, boil the noodles and ready the cheese</h2>
    <p>

        >Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
      </strong>
      We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of
      tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3 Assemble the ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat
      sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese.
      Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4 Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat.</h2>
