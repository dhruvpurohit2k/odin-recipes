    <h2>Step 1 Prepare the pizza dough.</h2>
    <p>
      Take a dough kneading plate and add all-purpose flour to it. Next, add
      salt and baking powder in it and sieve the flour once. Then, make a well
      in the centre and add 2 teaspoon of olive oil to it. On the other hand,
      take a little warm water and mix the yeast in it along with 1 teaspoon of
      sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15 minutes. The yeast will rise in
      the meantime. Once the yeast has risen, add it to the flour knead the
      dough nicely using some water. Keep this dough aside for 4-6 hours. Then
      knead the dough once again. Now, the pizza dough is ready.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base.</h2>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza
      base when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and
      take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this
      dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base
      is even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick
      the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put
      it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is
      ready.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3 Chop all the vegetables for the pizza.</h2>
    <p>
      Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the
      onions and cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut
      tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However, make sure that those
      tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now,
      grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4 Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h2>
    <p>
      Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread
      half the processed cheese all over the base and evenly put the veggies all
      across the base. Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of
      mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 5 Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celsius for 10 minutes</h2>
    <p>
      Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the
      pizza bake 10 minutes at 250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the
      baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes as per
      your taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated at
      250 degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)
