    <h2>Step 1</h2>

      Heat the oil in a non-stick pan over a medium-low heat. Add the onion
      along with a generous pinch of salt and fry for 10 mins, or until soft.
      Add the garlic and chilli, if using, and cook for a further minute.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>
      Stir the tomatoes, anchovies, olives and capers into the onion, bring to a
      gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 mins. Season to taste.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the
      spaghetti following pack instructions, then drain and toss with the sauce
      and parsley.
